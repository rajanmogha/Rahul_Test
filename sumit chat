Approach:
Represent the cities and roads as an undirected graph.
Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from city 0.
Keep track of whether the special ticket for odd-numbered cities has been used.
At each step, if the city is odd and the ticket is already used, skip that path.
Return the maximum path length from all possible paths.



Time Complexity:
O(N) – Building the graph and DFS traversal both take linear time.
Space Complexity:
O(N) – Additional space for the graph adjacency list and recursion stack in the worst case.
